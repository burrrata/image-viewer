    React Image Viewer
  </a>
</h1>

A web app that allows users to submit a text file with a list of image URLs and then view a slideshow that randomly displays images from that list.

The text file:
- the file needs to end in .txt
- on every line of the file needs to be a URL that points to a specific image (not a page with an image on it, but a direct link to the image)
- the app will split URLs on the whitespace inbetween each line

APOD_IMAGE_URLS.txt is an example of how the text file needs to be formated. Try downloading it, then going to to image viewer, and uploading it to see what happens.

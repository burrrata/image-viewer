# Image Viewer

A web app that allows users to submit a list of URLs that point to images, and then view a slideshow randomly displaying a URL from that list.
- the file needs to end in .txt
- on every line of the file needs to be a URL that points to a specific image (not a page with an image on it, but a direct link to the image)
- the app will split URLs on the whitespace inbetween each line
